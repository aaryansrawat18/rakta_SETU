## About The Project

Rakt Setu is a digital initiative to tackle the challenge of blood shortages. Our platform serves as a centralized, real-time directory of voluntary blood donors. The primary goal is to ensure that anyone in urgent need of blood can find a donor of the required blood group in their vicinity with minimal delay.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Simplify:** Provide an easy-to-use interface for both donors registering and users searching for blood.  
- **Accelerate:** Reduce the time it takes to find a blood donor during emergencies.  
- **Inspire:** Raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and encourage more people to become life-savers.
